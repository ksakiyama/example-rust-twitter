# Twitter CLI Client Example in Rust
This is a example of Twitter CLI client written in Rust.

This is my very practice Rust project.<br>
I thought that programming in Rust was very hard for me because I didn't understand Rust's strong type safe system. I wrote my first code, the compiler often gave me a lot of warnings and errorsüòÖ<br>
It took longer than I thought, I developed a small Twitter client using Rust. Rust had grown on meüòç

I published my source code on Github.<br>
If you are a Rust beginner and refer to my code, I'll be very happy.

## Usage
This small client has only two functions. Show timeline and tweet comment. You can use following commands.

### 0. Prepare
```bash
# resolve dependencies and build
cargo build
```

Save a configuration file on your home directory. 

~/.twclirc.yaml
```
CONSUMER_KEY: aaa
CONSUMER_SECRET: bbb
ACCESS_TOKEN: ccc
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET: ddd
```

### 1. Show home timeline
```bash
# show 10 tweets of your timeline in your commandline.
cargo run timeline 10
```

### 2. Tweet your text
```bash
# tweet your text on Twitter.
cargo run tweet "test tweet. remove this later."
```

## Dependencies
I used four libralies. They helped me a lot to get my program finished faster. And I realized that Rust's standard library has a few network library?

```toml
oauth-client = "0.3"
serde_json = "1.0.16"
config = "0.8"
clap = "~2.31"
```
